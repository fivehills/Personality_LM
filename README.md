n this project, we have refined the capabilities of a pre-existing sentiment analysis model ("cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest") to assess the Big Five personality traits for a given text/sentence. By meticulously fine-tuning this model using a specially curated dataset tailored for personality traits, it has learned to correlate specific textual inputs with distinct personality characteristics. This targeted approach has significantly enhanced the model's precision in identifying the Big Five personality traits from text, outperforming other models that were developed or fine-tuned on more generalized datasets.

The accuracy reaches 51%, and F1 score is 42%. Both are much higher than the similar personality-detection models hosted in huggingface. In other words, our model remarkably outperforms other models.
